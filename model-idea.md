# Modelling Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Population Dynamics

Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), Oryctes rhinoceros, is a major pest of palms. Adults bore into crowns to feed on sap. A palm may be killed if CRB feeding activity damages the meristem, but this rarely happens at low CRB population densities. CRB grubs do no damage. They feed on decaying vegetation with standing dead coconuts and fallen coconut logs being favored food source. In addition, they can feed in many types of organic matter including dead trees, green waste, saw dust, manure, compost, and even in bags of commercially packaged soil. 

There was a catastrophic change in CRB population dynamics on Guam as a result of damage from Typhoon Dolphin which impacted the island in 2015. 
Piles of decaying vegetation left in the wake of the typhoon provided an abundant food supply for grubs which resulted in synchronous emergence off large numbers adults several months later. Severe attacks to some palms resulted death. Dead, standing palms became breeding sites for grubs. Adults emerging from these breeding sites launched sever synchronized attacks on nearby palms. Thus the population dynamics changed from a low population limited by availablitiy of extrinsically produced by larval food supply, to a high population density state where palms killed by adults become an abundant intrinsically produced food supply resulting in high numbers of adults which kill even more palms. This type of uncontrolled positive feedback cycle initiated by an abundant larval food supply for CRB grubs has been documented elsewhare.

Our objective is to develop a mathematical model and a simulation model which can be used to investigate this interesting aspect of CRB population dynamics.
